# NCAA-March-Madness-ML-2023

This repository contains a Python script to predict the outcome of NCAA basketball games using machine learning algorithms from the scikit-learn package. The model is trained on historical data, capturing patterns and relationships that influence game outcomes. It uses numpy and pandas for data handling, sklearn for creating and training the model, and pickle for storing the trained model.

Main Features
Uses historical NCAA basketball game data to train predictive models.
Leverages popular Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and pickle.
Uses scikit-learn, a powerful library for machine learning in Python.
Can be applied to new data to predict game outcomes.
Model can be saved and loaded using pickle for future use without needing retraining.
